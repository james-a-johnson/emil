# emil

Emulation of Binary Ninja LLIL.

This project allows for emulation of programs that have been analyzed in a
Binary Ninja database. This allows for emulating programs that you don't trust
to run on your host or don't match the architecture of your host environment.

Emil is done as a capstone project for the Master of Science in Cybersecurity
program at Georgia Institute of Technology.

This work is currently a work in progress.
